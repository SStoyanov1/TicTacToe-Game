1. Start the TicTacToe.Services solution with visual studio and change your connection string if necessary
in the Web.config file. I use '.' to connect to MSSQLServer.
2. Start the localhost in the WebClient directory through the server.bat file.
3. Open in your browser the url 'http://localhost:1234/'.
4. Note that the first registration takes a while until the database is set up. Every one after that is fast.
5. Test by registering, logging and creating game  from one browser and registering, logging and playing in the
same game from another one.
6. Enjoy. Thank you for efforts.
